# vivarium73

vivarium73 is a real-time evolutionary simulation where autonomous creatures search for food, avoid obstacles, and evolve over generations.

- Energy is gained through food intake and depleted through travel or collisions.
- Creatures that reach full energy reproduce with mutations.
- Population collapse triggers a fresh restart with the ancestors of top performers.

## Controls
