# vivarium73

vivarium73 is a real-time evolutionary simulation where autonomous creatures search for food, avoid obstacles, and evolve over generations.

## Mechanics
- Creatures sense nearby food, obstacles, and other creatures
- Energy is gained through eating food and lost through movement and collisions
- Creatures that reach full energy reproduce with mutations
- Population collapse triggers a restart with both new creatures and the ancestors of top performers

## Controls
- Click on any free space to place food
- Select a creature to see its live stats
- Install the app on desktop or mobile
