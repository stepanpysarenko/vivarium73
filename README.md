# vivarium73

**vivarium73** is an evolution simulation where neural-network-controlled creatures navigate their environment to move, search for food, avoid obstacles, and evolve over time.
- creatures detect food and obstacles in their surroundings  
- they gain energy by eating and lose energy by moving  
- when a creature reaches full energy, it creates an offspring with a chance of mutation  
- if a creature runs out of energy, it dies  
- when all creatures are gone, the simulation restarts with the best-performing ones from the previous generation  
- over time, mutations can lead to more effective survival strategies
