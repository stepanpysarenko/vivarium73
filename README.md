# vivarium73

**vivarium73** is an evolution simulation where creatures move, search for food, avoid obstacles, and evolve.  
Each creature is controlled by a neural network that decides movement based on its environment.

### Mechanics
- Creatures detect food and obstacles in their surroundings  
- They gain energy by eating and lose energy by moving  
- When a creature reaches full energy, it creates an offspring with a chance of mutation  
- If a creature runs out of energy, it dies  
- When all creatures are gone, the simulation restarts with the best-performing ones from the previous generation  
- Over time, mutations can lead to more effective survival strategies
