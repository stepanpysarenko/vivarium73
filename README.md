# vivarium73

**vivarium73** is an evolution simulation where neural-network-controlled creatures move around search for food, avoid obstacles, and evolve over time.
- creatures detect food and obstacles in their surroundings  
- they gain energy by eating and lose energy by moving and hitting obstacles
- when a creature reaches full energy, it creates an offspring with a chance of mutation  
- if a creature runs out of energy, it dies  
- when all creatures are gone, the simulation restarts reviving the best-performing ones 
- over time, mutations can lead to more effective survival strategies
